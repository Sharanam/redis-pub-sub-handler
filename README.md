1. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create `.env` file with the necessary/default configuration settings.

   IS_STAGING = 1 // turn this off if using local

   REDIS_URL_LOCAL = "redis://127.0.0.1:6379";
   REDIS_PASSWORD_LOCAL = "";

   REDIS_URL_STAGING = "redis://#########";
   REDIS_PASSWORD_STAGING = "########";

   REDIS_DB = 0;
   WS_PORT = 8081;
   ```

3. Start the server with the command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Let the node process log `Redis connected to ...` message and then Open `localhost:3000` in browser.

## Redis Pub/Sub

#### Basics:

> The Redis Pub/Sub feature enables the exchange of messages between publishers and subscribers through channels.

> Messages are characterized into channels without specific subscribers, and subscribers express interest in one or more topics to receive relevant messages.

> This decoupling of publishers and subscribers allows for greater scalability and a more dynamic network topology.

#### Disclaimer:

> This repository is designed to consume an existing Redis instance (located somewhere in the world) for viewing and publishing messages in a more customized manner, using the provided connection. Please note that Redis is no longer open source. The codebase is intended for personal or internal use only.
